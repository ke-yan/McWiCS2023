4,The Ordinary,Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2031391-main-zoom.jpg?imwidth=135,5,combination,acne,After seeing some of the negative reviews on this product I was a bit hesitant. But after using this product for 2 weeks I have really noticed a difference. I struggle with hormonal acne which can be quite red and painful. The fact that I no longer use my prescription antibiotic spot treatment because of this product is amazing for me. I did a patch test for a couple days before applying it all over as others have recommended doing. I also find it has worked best with a gel moisturizer instead of oil based (I use Tatcha water cream and origins ginzing gel moisturizer).

 If you are using The Ordinary, make sure you research each product.

If you already have healthy skin you might not experience a drastic purge, however if you are like me then prepare for a month of acne and another half month of healing. The purge is worth it. I did not break out in areas that are unusual for me and the purge stayed in my usual problem areas. Now when I do have a whitehead, it goes away within a day and does not swell into a little volcano like it used to. I still have redness but the dark spots on my face are fast disappearing. 

 I did build up my skin’s tolerance to this through the use of other niacinamide products, so perhaps that helped. In any case, this is the best my skin has ever looked and felt.

This product had a learning curve to it, but I’ve finally figured it out. I first used it after the Tarte Knockout Tingling toner which I saw had niacinamide in it and I wanted to use them together for whatever reason. First off, That toner is STRONG. When I put the niacinamide on after that, my skin flushed, burned, itched, and stung for hours. I put makeup on later in the day and had flaky red skin and Looked like I sat in the sun for wayyyy too long. GUYS BE SMART. I caution you to wait a while after using acids or acid toner before you put this on because it can irritate. Also don’t use vitamin c because it can cause flushing as well. 

So when I finally decided to give it another try, I used it sparingly and carefully. One day I put a small amount on and washed it after a few hours. Used it again the next day and left it in overnight with a good moisturizer. This serum is so beautiful! My skin is clearer, brighter, and not irritated or dry. I love it! I wear it like a mask some days or still wear it at night and i have seen such beautiful results and a more even complexion because of this. And for 6 bucks?! Amazing. Try it out.

It’s strong enough to make a difference but not too strong where people with sensitive skin should worry.

Now in the grand scheme of all at home chemical peels, this is probably 3/5 stars. There is no comparison to DE Baby Facial or Dr. Gross Chemical Grade but those come with big price tags. You would have to use Ordinary every other day for a week to equal one treatment of the high end brands but for the price it’s worth adding to your collection.

If you’re someone who needs hydration for your skin, a hyaluronic acid serum like this one would be a great addition to your routine. Hyaluronic acid is one of the (if not THE) best ingredients out there when it comes to attracting moisture from the atmosphere to your skin. The best way to use this is to apply it onto a face that isn’t completely dry, then follow up with a moisturizer in order to lock that moisture in. Of course, if you have other skincare concerns, just using this serum won’t be enough to solve everything for you, and you’ll have to layer your other products in addition to your hyaluronic acid. It might be smarter to just buy another product that contains hyaluronic acid as well as other ingredients you need — this would decrease the number of layers you’d have to do, which is preferable. 

The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is the texture. It’s a watery gel but something about this serum feels a little slimy. It can even feel slightly sticky at first. I prefer The Ordinary’s Marine Hyaluronics much more. That product has a straight up watery texture (it literally feels like you’re putting water on your face) and is therefore much thinner and lighter in consistency, which makes it more ideal for layering.

So when the line went on sale on the ap I bought almost the whole range of products.

I normally live in a tropical climate and coming to a cold, dry climate has wreaked havoc on my skin.  Dry, scaly patches all over my face and neck no matter how much I moisturized and oiled (and I have a huge high-end skincare collection) and acne at the same time - come on!  I was trying everything and this serum is the only one that got rid of my dry flaky patches, and turned my skin into soft, porcelain texture, and OVERNIGHT.  This is an example of less is more folks.  You don't need a million ingredients to address a million problems you just need one that does what is says it will do!

A note on the texture.  Since this serum does not contain any skin-damaging alcohol like many serums, it has a thicker texture and is sticky when you first put it on.  The product does absorb beautifully but you need to wait a lot longer than a normal commercial serum before layering on any other skincare products or makeup.  I made the mistake the first time of only waiting a minute, layering on top of this the niacinamide serum for my acne spots, and so the serum pilled when I put on my moisturizer.  But I have since found that these two steps prevent pilling and leave me with baby soft, non-sticky skin:

1. If using more than one The Ordinary serum, I mix them together in my palm first then pat on, as opposed to layering one on top of the other.
2. I let the serums completely absorb before applying any other products

To give you a sense of my skin: it’s incredibly sensitive and acne prone; I have used Retin-A, antibiotics, Accutane, Spironolactone, Benzoyl Peroxide / Clindamycin, Aczone, Differin, Renee Roulee Anti-Bump serum (formerly Anti-Cyst), and countless other prescription and OTC products.

These peels are AMAZING! I have sensitive, dehydrated, flaky yet oily skin with cystic / hormonal acne, blackheads, and rosacea. When I started using these peels (once daily at night with nothing applied after), I had been fighting a horrible breakout of acne / blackheads / bumpy rash on my chin after discontinuing 200 mg Spironolactone (max dose). I had tried multiple different prescription and OTC acne products for over a month to try to clear the breakout to no avail. The first morning after using, my skin looked SO much clearer — the bumps had flattened, the acne didn’t hurt as much, my blackheads looked better, my complexion was more even, etc. The second morning, the pain was basically gone, the acne had almost completely flattened, blackheads and skin bumps looked immensely improved, etc. I’m hoping that my skin continues to progress in this way, and intend to write an updated review once I’ve been using longer.

I had no lasting irritation with this product, but the first night I used it, my face did flush and stay a bit red / warm for a few hours after application. It stings a bit *while* using but not after, and it does not leave my skin irritated. My face tingles intermittently for a few hours after application, which I love (it means something is working!).

If you have difficult skin and are scared to try these due to the ingredients, strength, and concept (peeling always made me think initial breakout), do not hesitate!

I had Drunk Elephant on my radar for over a couple years before biting the bullet and trying some of the products.

I had great skin in my teens, then my twenties hit, and my skin went downhill (mostly due to being on birth control & the different hormones). I have sensitive skin but also tan very well but I MUST keep my face out of the sun (due to tanning bed in my late teens early twenties & some bad sun burns on my face due to not wearing sunscreen). I have dark spots, freckles (a lot of them) & BAD melasma on my forehead. 

*The C-Firma™ Day Serum is now a must have staples in my morning skin care routine!!!!  I have noticed a better completion after using this and softer skin.

The issue I have with vitamin-c serums in general is that they seem to do a good job getting your skin to look radiant and healthy, but they don't actually fade your dark marks. I've made peace with that over the years, by using c-serum with other skin-brightening agents. So I find that this c-serum, in conjunction with my prescription acne-scar medication, really does the trick in imparting a more even and radiant skin tone.

I swear it went away after a week of use you just kinda get used to it and other products go on top so you stop noticing it.

Now, this serum is clear and does not tingle at all. I genuinely thought I received a defective product because this change hasn't really been advertised. After digging a little I realized that this is a new formula. I've used it for a few days and it's very... different.

The oxidation is also a real problem, it can feel like 2 different products if you get a fresh one vs one that is half into its shelf life.

I love the airtight twist pump bottle to help keep the product protected and fresh as long as possible. It’s lightweight and travels well. I mix one pump of this with one pump of bhydra in the morning and it’s more than enough to cover my face (avoiding eyes which I use the eye serum on) and neck with some left for the back of my hands. Depending on how dry I feel I’ll use the teal peptide moisturizer or some of the marula oil. Then top everything off with their umbra tint or their regular face spf. Was so happy to learn this serum topped with spf actually increases the effectiveness of the spf! With the mixture of the b-hydra, I don’t find it as sticky as others seem too.

Have been using it for close to a month in conjunction with many other DE products and thayers toner and have only seen slight differences in the overall appearance of my skin. Perhaps this is because of abnormal eating and drinking (sugar and alcohol) around the holidays, I’m just not sure. This serum is light orange and does have the smokey scent others have talked about. I love the airtight twist pump bottle to help keep the product protected and fresh as long as possible. It’s lightweight and travels well. I mix one pump of this with one pump of bhydra in the morning and it’s more than enough to cover my face (avoiding eyes which I use the eye serum on) and neck with some left for the back of my hands. Depending on how dry I feel I’ll use the teal peptide moisturizer or some of the marula oil. Then top everything off with their umbra tint or their regular face spf. Was so happy to learn this serum topped with spf actually increases the effectiveness of the spf! With the mixture of the b-hydra, I don’t find it as sticky as others seem too. Having all of these products layered on my face in the morning is new and I’m finding I don’t need as much foundation and have even left the house without foundation. So I guess my skin is improving, just nothing remarkable yet. I think I would recommend this for someone with a high budget.

I put these on over HUGE pimples I had and a few hours later I could already see the patch covered in white from all the gunk (sorry ew but also satisfying) and in the morning I’m telling you they are completely flat now it’s insane like I can’t recommend these enough!!!,True,sample,230240,facial-treatments,19.0,"Hydrocolloid Polymer Technology, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Retinyl Acetate",https://www.sephora.com/product/acne-healing-dots-P421275?icid2=products%20grid:p421275

This really does help in sucking out the bacteria in your pimples and you’ll see it when the patch turns white. That being said, it only works if the pimple is already broke or the surface is popped. It won’t work that well on under the surface cyst type acne. It’s good for a pimple you popped that still isn’t completely drained/healed.

One of my girlfriends pointed these out one day while in Sephora saying she wanted to try these out. 
About a year later, I received one as a sample. 
MONTHS later I wanted to give these babies a try and couldn’t with how expensive they are. 
So I tested it out with the 5-pack and have been buying the 5-pack for months now. I am hooked. They’re so easy to use. Perfect for right before makeup, or for right before bed. I prefer them for right before bedtime as you have this glowing effect with minimized pores and acne in the morning. Yep I said it. 

These are amazing Peel Pads. Yes it does tingle and slightly sting but that goes right away. Then I follow up with my skincare. 

***NOTE: This is not to be washed off.***

I’m trying to use them enough to start using the extra strength but trust me, you’ll see a difference in your skin. I like to use these 3 days in a row or every other day.

Yes this is a high concentration of AHA but they have included several soothing and calming ingredients to counteract any adverse reactions. This is a great 2 in 1 product. Typically BHA’s are better for oily skin or for people who have acne, as BHA h is oil soluble...it can dive deeper into your pores than AHA and really clean them from the inside out. AHA is typically better for people who have dry skin. This product contains BOTH and is great for ALL SKIN TYPES! Don’t be fooled by other AHA/BHA hybrids that come in jar packaging or any see through container. Drunk Elephant has mastered the science behind their serums and packaging.

This product has begun to make a tremendous difference with acne scarring. Some glycolic products are too harsh or not strong enough. This one is the perfect in between. If you haven't used glygolic prior to using this product, follow the instructions and build up a tolerance to it. You will not regret it. You will flake and skin will slough, but that is the product doing its magic and work. I did use both with the recommended Drunk Elephant Marula Oil and with Caudalie Overnight Recovery Oil; which both worked amazingly and I definitely recommend with use. It helps make the flaking/sloughing of skin not to obvious. You don't need to use this just for helping with scarring, it is great for helping to prevent wrinkles and making your skin a bit tighter.

I have been using this product for years and found significant skin improvement including minimal to no breakouts and healthy-looking and smooth skin.  If you only use one pump per day, a full-size bottle should last about 9 months, which is well worth the investment to me.

And while that face mask does wonders for your complexion, this serum gives you those same results everyday! In fact, using this serum every night, I have found that I don’t need to use the Sukari Baby Facial nearly as often. The combination of AHAs and BHAs in the TLC Framboos glycolic night serum keep my sensitive, combination skin under control. Even though I am in my thirties, if it is that time of the month or I am super-stressed put, then I will still breakout. But this serum is my secret weapon because when I use it daily, I find that my skin stays so much more clear (even during my period and when I am stressed out, etc.). I have tried so many products over the years and not a single serum, lotion or potion has improved my complexion as much as this serum has... especially in combination with all of the other amazing Drunk Elephant products that are a part of my morning and evening skincare routine. And if you really want to your skin to look like your using an IG filter (without actually needing to use one), alternate nights between using this serum and the DE retinol mixed with a few drops of marula oil in the evenings. Of course make sure to do all of the other important steps of your evening skincare routine, but I have noticed continuous improvement to my complexion since I went back to using all Drunk Elephant skincare products. I love this brand and they offer clean/green beauty products that actually work and over a matter of weeks you will actually physically be able to see and feel how much your complexion has changed for the better in not that many weeks time.

Had no idea what it was, to the point where I went to the doctor and they guessed it could be a vitamin B deficiency. I’m 29 and haven’t had that as an issue before so I highly doubted that was the case. 4 days ago I took the Framboos out of my nightly skin care routine and the rash healed right up. I live in the desert where the air is very dry so that + my already dry skin + the Framboos dried out my skin way too much.

And -Woooo hooo. Super effective. You have to make it work for you tho - not a one size fits all product. Dry skin people or sensitive combo skin - be careful - make sure you follow with a moisturizer. Extremely drying. Also if you have dry skin do not use everyday (alternate days or even every three days) and keep your skin hydrated. Smells awful but that’s lactic acid for you.

Also, can sting and itch at application - if it’s super itchy might be because your skin is dry. Itchiness subsided after 20 min for me. Next day skin was lovely - dark spots still there not really lightened - but the healthy skin I had was glowing. I can see how people with good skin love this.

Also, does nothing for existing acne. But again areas that were breakout free were so smooth and have stayed smooth so might be a good preventive serum to use a couple times a week.

And use sunscreen! I had spf 50 on and went for a hike the next day and at night my forehead was sunburnt - and I don’t burn easily. Make sure you wear your sunscreen!

I’ve been using this for 3 weeks and have noticed a difference in my skin. I bought this because I’ve been struggling with acne scars and Milia (white little bumps on my face) since wearing a full coverage foundation. It was a catch 22 because wearing a full coverage foundation was to cover my scars but making my skin worse but I didn’t want my scars to show then I’d get these little bump or a pimple that I’d end of popping to only get more scars.

So enter Good Genes and in 2 days no more Milia. I haven’t seen one since. So I knew something was working. About a week or so later I began to notice some scars fading or flaking because of skin turnover that Good Genes had helped make happen. I’m really excited to see more results as I continue to use this. I have deep and dark scars that I have been trying to get rid of for months. I’ve tried other high end products but never seeing results. Good Genes is definitely helping me with not only fixing the issues I have but preventing my skin from getting worse. 

Also a little goes a long way. Definitely try it out but give it about 2-3 weeks to notice some differences.

My skin has seriously never looked nor felt this good. It’s balanced, silky smooth, no acne flare ups and reduced redness, blackheads, and pore size. 
I struggled for a while to know WHEN and HOW OFTEN to use DE products, so i’m including my full routine for anyone who might benefit:
AM: cleanse with Clarisonic, Tatcha cleanser, and apply C-Firma mixed with B-Hydra. Once that’s sunk in, I use Umbra tinte for SPF. 
PM: if wearing makeup, cleanse with Slaai and then Tatcha with Clarisonic. I alternate days using Framboos & Tatcha water cream moisturizer OR A-Pass and B-Hydra mixed.

I'm happy I started with the Inkey Retinol - it def provides results if you're new to retinol - 'cuz yeah, not sure I could've started with the Drunk Elephant, you can tell it's just stronger. In the first couple times it was a little bit drying, so you def need to take it easy at first and only use once or twice a week to start. Also, I had to make sure to use some other extra hydrating products alongside it, like hydrating masks, and extra hydrating moisturizers. But now I've been using the Drunk Elephant and following it up with Kiehl's Midnight Recovery (a squalane-based hydrating oil to hydrate) and this is a magical combination. My skin feels luxuriously soft and smooth in the morning. You just need to make sure you have a nice hydrating product to use with this.

Don't use a cleanser that strips your skin, causing extra dryness. Get a good Hyaluronic Acid cream.

I’ve got some leftover pigmentation from breakouts and with my olive skin tone, they just never go away. I stepped up my use of this as recommended, from once a week to a few times a week to every other day, then nightly. Be very careful when using this product. I’ve used it and gone for a brow wax and had my skin ripped off. Although it recovered using Polysporin, you can’t go for a wax within 10 days of using retinol, which includes even one minimal application.

It has also flattened my raised bumps. It also has my skin looking rather clear and fresh upon waking and as a result I’ve barely been using my masks which I used to use every day. A tip: don’t scrub your skin with any type of exfoliant while using this product. It will make your skin very sensitive. Also, use only a pea size amount as directed.

I agree that it's a pain, but there's a reason that Drunk Elephant did not put this product in their signature twist top bottle. Retinol reacts to air by breaking down into an inactive oxidized product. In other words, prolonged exposure to air will make the product ineffective. Therefore, it has to be kept in an air-tight container, and that's why A-Passioni is in a metal tube. Because it's air-tight, when you take the cap off it releases pressure and product may ooze out involuntarily. But once you get the hang of dispensing the product (as I now have), a bit of hassle is much better than an entire bottle of spoiled retinol, in my opinion. I just keep a finger over the opening and release as needed to dispense the product until I have enough, then quickly twist the cap back on.

But now let's get to the actual product. I've never used a retinol product before and I am 28 with combination skin. I started with 1x/week application, then bumped up to 2x per week, and now I'm up to 3x/week after a few months of use. I never experienced any peeling or dryness, but I don't have sensitive skin and I have always followed up with a face oil (DE's Marula oil would be similar to what I use). I also mix DE's T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum with it, which is an Alpha Hydroxy Acid product.

I've struggled with my complexion for years due to PCOS and no other skincare products have ever made a difference. But A-Passioni and T.L.C. Framboos have completely changed the texture and tone of my skin. The hyperpigmentation spots from acne are gone, and my deeper scars are filling in as well. Not only that, but my fine forehead lines are disappearing too! I'm shocked when I look at before/after photos of myself. I can now confidently step out of the house without foundation or concealer, and that is a huge deal for me.

For me I like to use it on my forehead to smooth the fine lines, on some dark spots and acne scars on my face as well as the pesky laugh lines. Now the Drunk Elephant A-Passioni Retinol Cream is to be used one or two times a week AM or PM gradually increasing your frequency to every other night and then every night as your skin tolerates it. I personally use this twice a week for 2 weeks and then I use it about 4 days a week there after. The recommendation from Drunk Elephant is to use a pea-size amount or less to clean dry skin which is what I did. You can also mix it with your favorite Drunk Elephant Cream or Oil I used it the B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum included in the box of A-Passioni Retinol Cream and some of their Protini Polypeptide Cream. After the first application I was thrilled not to have any irritoation or redness at all (that was a first for me with Retinol) Then I used it a second time that week and had no issues. After my third application I woke up in the morning and just noticed my skin was a little dry after the 4th application dry and flakey so I used a thicker moisturizer and did not have an issue. I did continue to increase the use of the A-Passioni Retinal Cream to about 4 days a week and I had great results. My forehead fine lines had truly diminished and my acne scars were faded which meant I didn't have to use as much concealer.

I bought this product hoping to resolve some persistent (painfil, ugly, huge) hormonal acne on my jawline that I could never seem to completely vanquish as well as some scarring. Many products I tried improved the situation, but hadn't resolved it.
Enter this retinol. I have not had a major breakout in over a month, the acne spot patches I used to buy 40 of at least once a month are still 1/4 full from January.

I got samples of the A-Passioni and Protini when I bought the Littles Kit so I could try out Drunk Elephant and start a skincare routine.

First night I used A-Passioni mixed with Lala, Protini and B-Hydra to reduce the possibility of irritation. Had way too much of the mix so rubbed the rest on my arms (with KP). Woke up to soft skin and some of the KP bumps just flaked off. Used it again last night (3 nights later, this time with just Lala and B-Hydra) and I think that may have been too much too soon particularly since there was less buffer this go-around. Skin on my cheeks and around my mouth was flaking and feeling quite sensitive so I had to put an extra slather of moisturizer (Lala B-Hydra) within like 10 minutes. On the upside most of the bumps (milia?) around my neck were gone the next day. I'm laying off retinol until my face becomes less sensitive. I think I'll go back to buffering it with the Lala Protini B-Hydra mix, too, and just using the excess on my arms.

I find A-Passioni to be very effective but it's still a retinol so definitely use it with caution. Knocking off one star 'cause it's also darned pricey.

My skin is extremely sensitive. The first few tries with this product I peeled like crazy, just like many other reviewers have noted, BUT that is just a sign you're going too fast with application. I've used Avibon (A313) in the past and learned from that product that if you have sensitive skin, you need to apply moisturizer first, let that dry (about 15 mins) and then apply the retinol. A313 works but it made my skin itchy and never absorbs, which is annoying at night. The A-Passioni absorbs well and my skin is noticeably brighter in the morning. It also helps with breakouts, as in it will bring them to the surface for treatment. The people on here complaining about breaking out from the product are clearly not familiar with retinol -- purging is a standard experience and occurs because your skin is shedding. Stick with it, work into it slowly, and you'll see results. I started by applying only once a week for several weeks, and then 2x, and then 3x, and now I'm every other day. I use Cerave lotion for its ceramicides before applying. On my nights off I use Sunday Riley lactic acid, but once that bottle runs out I plan to switch to retinol every single night. The only reason I knocked off a star on this product is because the retinol spills out with even the gentlest pressure. I wish they'd put it in a pump or something.

Every morning, I religiously mix 1 pump C-Firma with 1 pump B-Hydra and apply to my clean face, neck and décolleté. The first couple of days, I didn't see much of that ""glow"" everybody was talking about. After almost a week of use, my skin radiates from under my makeup! 

A little about my skin, I am combo in the summer and a little drier in the harsh winter months. So dewy, hydrated skin is very much welcomed! I feel my skin stays hydrated throughout the day, my makeup applies beautifully on top without any issues.  

I have not really detected any sort of scent, at least nothing too potent or bothersome.  I am curious to see how long this bottle will last me when I use it daily. I have not used this product alone, as it was instructed to mix with the Firma-C for best results.  I find these results have come from combining these two in the morning. This is more of a treatment so you still need to apply moisturizer on top. I personally, give it at least 10 minutes to absorb into the skin before I apply my makeup.

Silicone free! And “clean,” so it’s free of a lot of the bad stuff.

B-Hydra is a very hydrating Pro-vitamin B serum with ceramides that truly feels amazing to my skin.
The texture is very lightweight and it gets absorbed immediately after application. I truly feel like my skin is begging for it since it gets absorbed right away. I normally apply it at night time after I double cleanse and follow it with a moisturizer for extra hydration during dry/cold days, however I use it by itself most days since I have combination/oily skin and I don’t need to wear a moisturizer everyday.
I enjoy the fact that Drunk Elephant formulates their products free of parabens, essentials oils and fragrances. They are perfect for people with sensitive skin like myself. They are very safe for everyone!
B-Hydra is a product that I truly enjoy and I will continue to use. My skin just feel healthier and it seems more radiant, brighter and even after continuos use of this product.

The texture is a thick, liquid-gel like consistency, and while it applies a tiny bit sticky, the stickiness subsides as soon as skin absorbs it. I usually apply after toner and any acids, before moisturizing serums, moisturizer and face oil. It does not make makeup pill or anything (unlike a couple of other The Ordinary products).

With any skincare product, you do have to be patient. Time is the best thing for waiting for hyperpigmentation (for me the issue is post-breakout ones) but this product will help it along. If you can give the time it takes to use up the entire bottle (probably a few months with consistent AM and PM daily use) you will probably see results.

I also had an inflamed pore/papule that was lagging in healing, and applying this made a noticeable difference overnight. It wasn't all gone, but it at least improved somewhat.

1. It tingles while it’s drying and can be a little intense on the skin.
2. The mask is very thin and runny, it also has small clumps in it that feel like a little scrub. Since the consistency is so thin, it dries on surfaces within minutes, especially if it’s in a thin layer. 
3. It will be drying if left on for longer then 20 minutes. (I have combination skin)
The mask is very easy to apply,but for best application I’d recommend using a foundation brush to spread it evenly. As the mask dries you are able to see where your pores are, and the longer you leave it on the more you can see them because the mask continues to pull oil none-stop. When it’s completely done it’ll be a light gray with of course darker areas where the oil is being pulled from.

1. It tingles while it’s drying and can be a little intense on the skin.
2. The mask is very thin and runny, it also has small clumps in it that feel like a little scrub. Since the consistency is so thin, it dries on surfaces within minutes, especially if it’s in a thin layer. 
3. It will be drying if left on for longer then 20 minutes. (I have combination skin)
The mask is very easy to apply,but for best application I’d recommend using a foundation brush to spread it evenly. As the mask dries you are able to see where your pores are, and the longer you leave it on the more you can see them because the mask continues to pull oil none-stop. When it’s completely done it’ll be a light gray with of course darker areas where the oil is being pulled from.

In that regards I give it a shining 5/5. I work as a nurse and we use hydrocolloids for multiple reasons when dressing wounds or stabilizing external tubes/drains. These are stickier so they really stay well on the skin and they actually have grabbed a blackhead or two when I've pulled them off. 
I find that if I use these once to twice a week in conjunction with my glam glow facemask, my skin does really well. 

when using these I wash my face for the night, put on toner, and then put these bad guys wherever I get visible pores the most (forehead, nose, and below my cheekbones). I then follow the rest of my routine on exposed skin and sleep with the strips on. I find the longer the sit the better they work.

because hydrocolloids are meant for wounds, I love using these on broken skin for those pimples I couldn't keep my stupid mitts off of. it get the drainage out, helps remove the infection, and promotes healing. just remember to take it off an hour before makeup so a scan can form so you're not putting makeup in an open wound.",True,sample,211848,facial-treatments,19.0,"Declustered Water \Aqua\Eau DeStructuree, Declustered Water \Aqua\Eau DeStructuree, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth20, BisPeg18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Yeast Extract\Faex\Extrait De Levure, Sucrose, Glycereth26, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil, Medicago Sativa Seed Powder, Helianthus Annuus Seedcake, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Seed Meal, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Sodium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Calcium Gluconate, Magnesium Gluconate, Zinc Gluconate, Tocopheryl Succinate, Niacin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Powder, Citrus Aurantifolia Peel Extract, Glycine Soja Seed Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Palmaria Palmata Extract, Codium Tomentosum Extract, Laminaria Saccharina Extract, Sea Salt\Maris Sal\Sel Marin, Plankton Extract, Caffeine, Polyquaternium51, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Glycine Soja Protein, Tourmaline, Acetyl Hexapeptide8, Glycosaminoglycans, Peg8, Sodium Hyaluronate, Alcaligenes Polysaccharides, Sodium Pca, Urea, Ppg5Ceteth20, Jojoba Wax Peg120 Esters, Polysorbate 20, Hexylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Trehalose, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Fragrance, Disodium Edta, Limonene, Geraniol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Phenoxyethanol",https://www.sephora.com/product/peace-out-pores-P428250?icid2=products%20grid:p428250

I tried many, and I know a few good Vitamin C products, but this C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum stands out not only for the effectiveness but also for the texture and feel of the product. 

It looks beautiful on my skin by itself but also works great with most of the liquid foundations I have (Marc Jacobs, Fenty, tarte, Revlon, and M.A.C) .

When applied on my face, it has a little sticky, gummy, syrup like texture, which I liked. I think this texture helped a little to keep the makeup in place?

It is moisturizing, so for example, Korres Vitamin C Oil is very drying by itself and always has to be paid with additional moisturizing product. With C.E.O. Vitamin C serum, you can just wear this after washing face and wear makeup right after if you want to. 



PROS:
- Effective
- Delivers Vitamin C into a deeper layer of skin than water soluble Vitamin C
- Nice subtle sent
- Very Stable
- Skin looks pretty after application
- Works great with liquid foundation
- Doesn’t exaggerate wrinkles and pores after applying makeup (great for mature skin)
- Wonderful feel and texture

At first I was very impressed by the results, especially on my most problematic area of skin (between my eyes on the bridge of my nose). My skin is quite resistant to new products, so first-time results are rare and welcome. Only one situation causes me to break out: wearing sunglasses while sweating heavily. That happens maybe once a year when I forget to remove my glasses. Aside from that, acne has never been an issue throughout my 40 years of life. Unfortunately, after three weeks of using as directed, my skin dried out badly. I began to see strange little bumps in my problem area, which initially responded very well to this serum. So I did some digging. This product, like so many others, contains dimethicone. It’s one of the first ingredients. I somehow missed that the first time I read the ingredients list. Dimethicone is FDA-approved but it’s a manmade silicone. That means it fills your pores and sits there. That can make you look gorgeous...for a while. But eventually, it catches up with you. Dimethicone blocks your pores and disables your skin from performing its natural, self-cleansing process. In the long run you’ll end up looking more wrinkled and dried out. It could take longer than three weeks for you; maybe it happened quickly for me because I’m older. All my other skincare products are 100% natural and organic (not sold by Sephora), and I have no issues with anxiety or hormonal imbalance. My skin’s reaction during this trial use was caused by this serum, no question.

The only retinol I’ve ever used is in the Luna oil & Kate Somerville Vit C serum, which I love. I don’t have any problem using it with Good Genes or other acids; I’ve built up a tolerance, so I used this every day for 4 days (sample). I was hoping it would be stronger than Luna, perhaps a comparable product to the DE Passioni, but I think this is just more hydrating than Luna. I didn’t notice any brightening or evenness comparable to when I use Luna alone, and when I combined it with an acid serum it also didn’t add anything. In fact I woke on day 2 with added texture and redness on my nose (which happens when serums and oils are too oily/ moisturizing) and by day 4 it hadn’t gone away. If you know anything about retinoids they should have a pretty immediate effect, it’s not like most skincare that could take 2 months to see effects.

If you use Luna and enjoy it, stick with it. I think Luna does way more for redness (maybe it’s the blue dye?), and my skin felt plump rather than just moisturized. This serum made me wake up feeling oily/ shiny moisturized whereas Luna I wake and my skin is dry (absorbed the oil) and it’s glowing and plump and soft.  However if you hate the Luna smell (which I think is great, though noticed it being a bit sweeter last time I bought it in Nov), this doesn’t really have a fragrance nor is there a dye.

This works better than Vit C for acne and sun damage and can be used in conjunction with other products (like Vit C) to attack dark spots on many fronts.

Tip/Trick:  If you have bad under-eye dark circles, pat the residual from your finger tips, under your eyes after applying to your face.

This serum has made a significant difference in keeping them clean on a daily basis even with layers of skincare and makeup.  A clean pore is a smaller looking pore.  

I apply this 2x/day after toner and essence, but before other serums, moisturizer and sunscreen.  

My Tips...
1). It potentially can be drying if you don’t use a moisturizer.  
2). Sunscreen is a must when using this during the day.

1. The company discloses the percentage of arbutin. 
2. The price is very affordable.

It might be good for slightly lightening your overall skin tone, but not powerful enough to lighten already-darkened brown spots in a short time (1-2 months). 

It might be going to lighted brown spots if I continue using this product for a long time, sat for more than 6 months, but I really don’t like the texture of this product and don’t feel like continuing using it till I start seeing the result.

Unfortunately, if I try using this on medium to large sized blemishes, they seem to freeze in place for a while before seemingly disappearing overnight. These tend to leave hyper-pigmentation marks but I believe that these blemishes would have if they were left to their own devices. 

Either way, I find it really effective as I know the large ones would probably have gotten a lot bigger, redder and more painful to manage. I think this is playing a big part in the management of my acne as I work to clear my skin so I am very satisfied.

In addition, I tend to have multiple spots on my face and this has lasted me a long time.

I was not kind to my skin throughout school and built up layers of hyperpigmentation from acne scars. I have been actively trying to address these scars and was excited to give Invisicar a try. 

In the first 2 weeks, most of the changes were textural. With each day, I could feel my skin smoothening to an evening texture. By the end of week 2, I noticed a bit more brightness, especially around my cheekbones. 

In weeks 3 and 4, I noticed some of the lighter or smaller dark spots starting to fade. At this point, some of the larger, darker spots were still noticeable. 

After 6 weeks, the larger, darker spots starting to reduce in size and fad. Still noticeable, but appeared a bit smaller and a little bit lighter than before. 

In the last two weeks, my most prominent dark spots did not change in size. However, I noticed that there was a little bit of brightness and increased evenness in tone. 

Given that I have dark skin with a lot of dark hyperpigmentation, I knew that I wasn’t’ going to get rid of everything. Still, Invisiscar helped me to see how much hyperpigmentation was set in my skin. I’m pleased with the results, and Invisiscar has reset my skin with a newfound tone and texture that I hope continues to improve, and I will purchase this product again.

the consistency is like a primer and yes, the bottle is tiny. i've only been using it as a spot treatment on acne scarring from an explosion of breakouts in May 2019 so i have no complaints about how long it lasts. a few of these areas on my skin were fairly 'active.' my morning routine: witch hazel, murad invisiscar spot treatment, cerave lightweight moisturizer, makeup( (IT CC Cream). night routine: dermanlogica double cleanse balm, Lira SA acne cleanser, caudalie glycolic night cream. two nights a week, OTC retinol. this is all to say, i'm doing plenty of other things to fade my scars.

two takeaways:
1. this did not make me break out further, which is a major plus. it has SA, which probably helps keep future breakouts at bay. for that reason, i recommend this for hot spot areas that seem to breakout every month.
2. when i started using an OTC retinol every other night, i noticed this spot treatment accelerated my peeling (i tested it in spots) so it DOES work to exfoliate. 

could it be stronger? probably, but i'd trade slower results for a cream that wont make me break out.",True,sample,169664,facial-treatments,35.0,"Dimethicone, Polysilicone11, Ascorbic Acid, Silica, Dimethicone, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Hexylresorcinol, Salicylic Acid, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxytyrosol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Fragrance, Limonene, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide",https://www.sephora.com/product/invisiscar-resurfacing-treatment-P446423?icid2=products%20grid:p446423

It’s worked better than any other treatment I’ve tried. I would recommend either this product if you’re okay with silicones (this has a distinct silicone texture and smoothness to it) OR the dark spot corrective treatment by Kiehl’s (if you have skin that’s sensitive to silicones). I rated the Kiehl’s 5/5 stars because it didn’t have any silicones in it, and definitely worked as far as reducing old acne scars. However, this product has worked better and quicker than the Kiehl’s one. The only reason I took away a star from this review is because it did break me out a little bit, due to the silicones. However, it only broke me out in the hollows of my cheeks, which is the area of my face I’m most likely to break out in (regardless of products used). I pretty much scar any time I get acne, so I wait until the blemish has disappeared and usually within a week the new scars fade and by the end of week two, the scar is completely vanished from my face. With my old acne scars, it takes about 2 weeks to see noticeable fading, and by the end of week 3 the scar is visibly less noticeable. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and the only scar that’s left has been my trouble scar (nothing has completely gotten rid of it). But what’s important to me is this, is DEFINITELY not as dark and noticeable and it keeps diminishing its appearance week after week. So I’m very hopeful for the end of week 8, as this product demonstrates. I really only need about 1/2 pump for all the spots on my face, morning and night. You don’t need to use a lot of this product because the silicone does carry and spread this product over patches of the skin if you want (cuz I have some patches on my skin where I have some clusters of scars).

I feel like it is noticeably less red/dimensional than it used to look, however did not really do much for the ice-pick-like scar I was hoping to diminish the appearance of with this product. It has a thicker consistency that doesn't really work all that well under concealer, so I would not recommend AM use if you're planning on putting makeup on top of this (for that reason, I would only plan on using this product at night if you apply makeup on top of your scarring during the day). I am going to keep using this for another 3-4 weeks and see if I notice any more of a difference - and will update this review again accordingly.
